# Cookie Cutter Flask (Work in progress)
This is a cookie cutter (i.e., template or example) on how I like to setup my Flask projects.
> **Note: This is structured for a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Setup
1. To setup up this project you should have python installed with virtual environments.
> python -m pip install virtualenv
> python3 -m pip install virtualenv
2. Create your virtual environment. Note that 'venv' will be the name of your virtual environment.
> python -m virtualenv venv
> python3 -m virtualenv venv
3. Activate your virtual environment
    * Mac OS
    > source ./venv/bin/activate
    * Windows
    > ./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
4. Install the requirements.txt
> pip install -r ./requirements.txt
> python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
> python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
5. Optional: Upgrade pip
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
